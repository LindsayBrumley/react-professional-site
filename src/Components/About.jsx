          Hello there! 👋 I'm Lindsay, a recent graduate of Fullstack Academy's
          coding bootcamp. My journey into the world of tech is a bit
          unconventional—I've worn many hats before finding my passion for
          coding.

          🚀 Tech Explorer: Having delved into the intricacies of software
          development at Fullstack Academy, I'm thrilled to navigate the
          ever-evolving landscape of technology. It's a fascinating realm where
          I see the beautiful harmony between code and creativity.

          🎵 Musical Coder: When I'm not immersed in lines of code, you can find
          me lost in the world of music. As a musician, I appreciate the
          parallels between crafting a melody and coding a program—both are art
          forms that blend logic and creativity seamlessly.

          💇‍♂️ From Scissors to Code: In a previous chapter of my life, I was a
          business owner and hairstylist. Now, I'm embracing the exciting
          challenge of transitioning into the tech industry. It's a leap I'm
          eager to take, fueled by a passion for problem-solving and innovation.

          📚 Non-Traditional Achiever: What makes my journey unique is that I
          didn't follow the traditional path of a four-year college. This
          accomplishment is not just about learning to code; it's about proving
          that determination and dedication can lead to success, no matter the
          starting point.

        <p className="p">
          I'm excited about the endless possibilities in the tech world and
          can't wait to share this journey with you. Thanks for stopping by!
